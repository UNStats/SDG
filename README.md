## SDG Repositiry

This is the collaborative space for our tools and data around the SDG indicators. 

## Purpose

Data requirements for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 169 targets and over 230 global indicators, present an unprecedented challenge for both national statistical systems and the international statistical community. In the UN General Assembly Resolution 70/1, Member States stressed that follow-up and review processes at all levels would be based on high-quality, accessible, timely, reliable data, disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other characteristics. Also, both GA resolution 70/1 and Statistical Commission decision 47/101(l) stress that the compilation of the global SDG indicators is to be based on data produced by national statistical systems.
